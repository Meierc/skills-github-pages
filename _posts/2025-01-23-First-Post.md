This is just a page to learn more about the github site.

Nothing intressting is going to be here. (I guess)

If you came here, you can stay as long as you want.
I know the internet can be an noisy, violent, filled with hate and ignorance.
But there are also some quiet, and chilling places. Hopefully this might be one.

At last but not least, keep your head up and try your best to survive and help others to survive,
not only on the internet but also on this hellhole called earth.
